# Find_extra_slot

Project By:- Tushar Vatsal (Enrollment No: 2019ECE092)

I designed a python program to find slots for a extra class of a particular course in a particular fractal considering the time table, enrolled students in the course,
availabilty of professor and availability of room.

In output, I am providing the day, slot no. and also available room for the extra class.

Note:

1. Run the Extra_Slot.py python file.
2. There are two input given by user:

   Input1 -> Input current running fractal (e.g: "2"). Consider 6 fractal, so enter a number between 1-6.

   Input2 -> Input course code for which extra class is required(e.g: "CS301 (16)")

3. Open sample.png file to see the output sample.
